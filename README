To use this framework, you will need to install SDL 2.0 (formerly SDL 1.3), SDL_ttf and SDL_image.

###Windows Users - read this!###
If you don't want to spend time compiling SDL, but just start on your game right away, you can download go2d_windows_bin.zip (click on Downloads on the github page for Urmel/Go2D) for compiled versions of all needed DLL files and the two Go libraries
